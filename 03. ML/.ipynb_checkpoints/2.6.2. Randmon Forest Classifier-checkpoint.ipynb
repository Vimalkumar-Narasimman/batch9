    "Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It has two variations – one is used for classification problems and other is used for regression problems. It is one of the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. It creates decision trees on the given data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It is also a pretty good indicator of feature importance.\n",

Random forests is very slow in making predictions because large number of decision-trees are used to make predictions. All the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same input and then perform voting on it. So, it is a time-consuming process.\n",

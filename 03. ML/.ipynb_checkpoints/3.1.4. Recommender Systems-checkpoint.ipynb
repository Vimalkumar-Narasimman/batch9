    "Research on recommender systems is focussed towards finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. There are a number of factors that are also important. These are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diversity** – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity. For example, items from different artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recommender persistence** – Sometimes, it is more effective to re-show recommendations than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time. May be they do not inspect the recommendations initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy** – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns because users have to reveal sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User demographics** – User demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness** – When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serendipity** – Serendipity is a measure of how surprising the recommendations are. For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate. But it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trust** – A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Labelling** – User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labelling of the recommendations."
